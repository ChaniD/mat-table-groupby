# mat-table-groupby

This is a development of the code created in the two stackblitz projects posted in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/52217179/angular-material-mat-table-row-grouping/52706931#52706931

I've suggested that it be included in material2/src/lib/table/table-data-source.ts like the sort and paginate features (see https://github.com/angular/material2/issues/10660)
